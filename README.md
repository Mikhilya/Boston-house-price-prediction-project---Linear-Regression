# Boston-house-price-prediction-project---Linear-Regression
House price prediction using Linear Regression. In this project, I did data preprocessing, data analysis and visualization. Based on the observations, I used **Linear Regression** and build a model which can predict the home prices in the Boston city based on different features like age, area, no.of rooms, distance to main centres etc.
